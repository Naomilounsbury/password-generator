# password-generator

## I created a password generator. Well, it wasn't me alone, sophie and armando and niles all helped a lot both with pushing me on what to do next and pointing me in the right direction. But as its a homework assignment, I feel like I should probably say I did all the work, but its not true. 
## Anyway, while the password generator does work in the way I want it to, there are a couple things that might be issues. 

### The only thing that might be an issue is that the first four items of the password will alway go "character" "upper case" "lower case" "number",which may make it a little less than random. But on the plus side, not everyone is going to want all the things in their passcode so that makes it a little more random.
