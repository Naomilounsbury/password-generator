# password-generator

## I created a password generator. Well, it wasn't me alone, sophie and armando both helped a lot both with pushing me on what to do next and pointing me in the right direction. But as its a homework assignment, I feel like I should probably say I did all the work. 
## Anyway, while the password generator does work in the way I want it to, there are a couple things that might be issues. 

### * For the first prompt, "How long do you want your password to be? Please enter a number between 8 and 128." I wrote it like that because I didn't want to deal with making it say "please enter a valid number" and not letting people go further. That would be annoying and I'm lazy. So if someone enters a number between 1 and 4, it will pop out a 4 character password(unless they don't choose true on all questions), if someone enters a number between 5 and 8, that number password will pop out. If they press cancel, they'll have to click through all the prompts and end up with nothing.

### The second issue is that the first four items of the password will alway go "character" "upper case" "lower case" "number",which may make it a little less than random. But on the plus side, not everyone is going to want all the things in their passcode so that makes it a little more random.
